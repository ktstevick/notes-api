## About

### Purpose
Utilizing Django and React.js, this app aims to allow users to manage notes. Reading a pre-made list, creating new notes, deleting old ones, and more.

### Context
This project was made as part of a code assessment, and I had a lot of fun with it.

## Installation

Django back-end should be running before Vite front-end. This was my process:

From Django/notes_demo folder, with Windows cmd:
<code>python manage.py runserver</code>

From Vite folder, with Git Bash:
<code>npm run dev</code>

**-- NOTE --** 
```
PLEASE ensure that back-end is live at http://127.0.0.1:8000/ and the front-end is live at http://localhost:5173, otherwise CORS will block requests or the front-end may not connect to the proper API endpoints.
